# PDD project ideas

### Regexes for emails, phones, etc.
Can we find well known regexes from official sources such as RFC2822 email validation for example : https://regexr.com/2rhq7 ?

### Addresses
Should addresses be verified using a third party API, or from a downloaded database, from official sources such as
https://adresse.data.gouv.fr/donnees-nationales for example ?

### Company data
In the same manner as for addresses, company data can be verified from official sources

### First and last names
Names can be verified from a downloaded database based on exact match (or a scoring), we can also translate them and see if they remain the same. 

### Stopwords 
Stop words should be removed to facilitate all tasks
